Using Paired-Comparison Models to find Hitbox Advantages

Paired-Comparison (PC) Models are used to predict the preferences of participants during a taste-test or outcomes from a competition
of one or many competitors. Using PC Models with regressors allows specific attributes about the participants of a comparison to be
measured in addition to a latent strength or preference. In this project, over 1,000,000 matches from SaltyBet.com from over 5,000 
unique characters was analyzed to determine if hitbox differences were a significant predictor of success. A hitbox of an individual
character consists of the dimensions of the image defining a character. Popular opinion states that if a hitbox height difference 
crosses a certain threshold, then the character with the lower hitbox has an advantage. This opinion is explored in detail and
a discussion of using this model for real-time prediction of matches is included.
